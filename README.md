# Vulnserver
These are the exploits I've created for Vulnserver

I will post a write up explaining each exploit, and possibly a video.

For now see exploits for each command with a Spike file for fuzzing. 

Commands exploited:
-trun (basic stack BoF)
-hter (basic stack BoF with a twist)
-kstet (BoF with egghunter)
-gmon (BoF with SEH and Egghunter)
